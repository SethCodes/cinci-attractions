    "content": "One of the big draws is the outdoor patio which is enclosed by a brick wall that was constructed from reclaimed building materials. Ornate architectural details, lights strung overhead and a large tree create an enchanting nighttime setting. Outside restaurants serve food from the patio grill. Several giant Jenga games, live bands four nights a week, and Tuesday movie nights provide the entertainment. Fire pits extend the season of the patio into the colder months. Inside, exposed brick walls are adorned with artwork created by Neons' own employees. Upstairs you'll find a pool table and living-room-like area with a TV and couches. A visit to Neons would not be complete without trying one of their cocktails. Neons makes their own infusions that can be served straight or crafted into a cocktail.",
